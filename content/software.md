## Max for Live devices

* Software I've developed over the years, using Max/MSP and gen~. I've used these on many records. They should mostly work, please contact me with details if they are broken.

![Ethanol](/software/ethanol.png)
*Ethanol* -- decalcified granular synthesiser. -- [Download](https://github.com/bladelore/ethanol-m4l) -- (2022 - 2024)
* Real-time onset sliced granular synthesis (like Ableton's simpler but you can record into the buffer).
* Per-grain effects (SVF filter and delay line).
* Unique granular time stretching algorithm.
* Cool grain polarity modulation options.
* Fully modular: LFO, ramp, random mod source, envelope follower, keytrack and midi CC mod sources.

![Death String](/software/death-string.png)
*Death String* -- chaotic wavefolded string model. -- [Download](https://github.com/bladelore/death-string-m4l) -- (2023 - 2024)
* Very weird string model.
* Uses velvet noise, stereo delay line, and a waveshaper...
* Can process external inputs (sounds amazing).
* Fully modular: LFO, ramp, random mod source, envelope follower, keytrack and velocity mod sources.

![Padsynth rt](/software/padsynth-rt.png)
*Padsynth rt* -- Spectral additive resonator -- [Download](https://github.com/bladelore/padsynth-rt-m4l) -- (2022 - 2024)
* Real-time phase vocoder implementation of Paul Nasca's classic padsynth algorithm.
* Vocode external audio.
* Use generator functions to control the distribution of amplitudes.
* Fully modular: x2 LFO, random, and envelope follower mod sources.
